EECS 731 Project 4 - Major Leagues
Main goal:
Build one or more regression models to determine the scores for each team using the other columns as features

Initial setup:
Data downloaded from: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mlb-elo
I'll be using the mlb_elo.csv file as that contains data from 2020 back to the 1800's.
As a note for column names, I don't really know much about Baseball myself so some explenations are needed:
Column          Definition
date 	        Date of game
season 	        Year of season
neutral 	    Whether game was on a neutral site
playoff 	    Whether game was in playoffs, and the playoff round if so
team1 	        Abbreviation for home team
team2 	        Abbreviation for away team
elo1_pre 	    Home team's Elo rating before the game
elo2_pre 	    Away team's Elo rating before the game
elo_prob1 	    Home team's probability of winning according to Elo ratings
elo_prob2 	    Away team's probability of winning according to Elo ratings
elo1_post 	    Home team's Elo rating after the game
elo2_post 	    Away team's Elo rating after the game
rating1_pre 	Home team's rating before the game
rating2_pre 	Away team's rating before the game
pitcher1 	    Name of home starting pitcher
pitcher2 	    Name of away starting pitcher
pitcher1_rgs 	Home starting pitcher's rolling game score before the game
pitcher2_rgs 	Away starting pitcher's rolling game score before the game
pitcher1_adj 	Home starting pitcher's adjustment to their team's rating
pitcher2_adj 	Away starting pitcher's adjustment to their team's rating
rating_prob1 	Home team's probability of winning according to team ratings and starting pitchers
rating_prob2 	Away team's probability of winning according to team ratings and starting pitchers
rating1_post 	Home team's rating after the game
rating2_post 	Away team's rating after the game
score1 	        Home team's score
score2 	        Away team's score

"Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis"
My first look over the data is a bit overwhelming to be honest. There's quite a few possible features here and I'm not 100% sure what carries more impact on the game scores.
So far the only thing that looks unnecessary might be the date and season since I can't think of how those would effect the outcome of a game themselves.
I may remove the date/season and convert the team appreviations via one-hot encloding. Most other features are numerical so I believe it's best to have matching types.

After looking at the data types, pitcher1 and pitcher2 (names of the pitchers) are not needed and will also be removed to streamline the features.
Most other data types seem to be float64, this matches my idea of converting them all to similar data types.
elo_prob1, elo_prob2 also don't seem super useful and will be removed 

Actions:
- Remove pitcher1, pitcher2 columns
- Remove elo_prob1, elo_prob2 columns
- Remove date, season columns
- Convert team1, team2 to integers via one-hot pd.get_dummies

"Build one or more regression models to determine the scores for each team using the other columns as features"
I'm going to be trying Linear Regression first, it seems like the simplest option to start with. 
Following:
https://notebooks.azure.com/keshanmuga/projects/2018-Linear-Regression/html/Example%20Linear%20Regression%20-%20Cricket%20Chirps.ipynb
and
https://www.wintellect.com/creating-a-simple-linear-regression-machine-learning-model-with-scikit-learn/

I'll begin by moving the score1 and score2 to the beginning of the columns. score1 and score2 are my dependent variables, other features will be independent

I decided to try the ".corr()" function built into pandas to try and spot any correlation, it seems like a very useful function to me though with the number of
columns I have it might be a bit overwhelming.
Using result1, result2 sorted columns I see that:
rating_prob
elo_post
rating_post
for score1 and score2 are the three highest correlations. I guess I should focus on these.
